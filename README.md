# PacMan in the TorusVerse
My team and I developed PacMan in the TorusVerse as part of our SWEN30006 coursework at The University of Melbourne. The game extends the traditional pacman game by introducing several new features:
1. Five new unique monsters, each having distinct behaviours.
2. New items which PacMan can consume to change behaviour of monsters.
3. Portals which allows PacMan to teleport from one place to another.
4. A Map Editor which players can use to create their own playable maps and stored in the form of xml files.

# Installation & Setup
1. Build and Run pacman.src.Driver with 3 possible command-line arguments, which will affect how the game is launched.
2. Valid Arguments:
- An valid xml file which represents a map. 
- A folder containing multiple numbered xml files (eg. 1_map.xml, 2.xml, 3_xxx.xml), which will be played based on numbering sequence.
- No arguments, which starts the game in Map Editor mode, allowing you to choose a file to load and play.
